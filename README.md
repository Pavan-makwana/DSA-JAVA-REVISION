# 🧠 DSA Java Revision by Pavan Makwana

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Practice Repository**!  
This repo is where I track my daily problem-solving progress in **Java** as part of my preparation to become a strong Software Developer.

---

## 📚 Overview

I started this repository to rebuild and strengthen my DSA foundation from scratch.  
Here, I’ll be solving problems topic-wise and maintaining detailed notes on logic, approach, and complexity.

---

## 📂 Folder Structure

Each folder represents a specific DSA topic:

```
DSA-Java-Revision/
│
├── Arrays/
├── Strings/
├── LinkedList/
├── Trees/
├── Graphs/
└── DynamicProgramming/
```

Inside each folder, I include:
- Java solution files (`.java`)
- A topic-specific `README.md` summarizing problems and approaches

---

## 🧩 My Workflow

1. I create a new Java file for every problem I solve.  
2. I write clean and well-commented code to ensure readability.  
3. I update the folder’s README with a short description of the problem and approach.  
4. I commit and push my progress daily to keep my streak and consistency.

## 🏁 Example Commit Pattern

```bash
git add Arrays/ReverseArray.java
git commit -m "Day 1: Solved Reverse Array problem"
git push
```

## 📊 Progress Tracker

| Day | Topic | Problem | Approach | Status |
|-----|--------|----------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Arrays | Reverse Array | Two-pointer method | ✅ |
| 2 | Strings | Palindrome Check | Compare start/end characters | ✅ |
| 3 | Arrays | Max Element | Linear scan | ✅ |

## 🎯 Goal

- Solve **150+ DSA Problems** in Java before **June 2026**
- Build strong problem-solving and logical thinking skills  
- Prepare efficiently for coding interviews

## 💬 Motivation

> “Consistency beats talent when talent doesn’t stay consistent.”  
> Every single commit brings me one step closer to my Software Developer goal.
